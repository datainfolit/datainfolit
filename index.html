  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the working space for the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/" target="_target">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a> funded research project investigating data information literacy (DIL) needs of e-scientists. With the continued evolution of technology driven research or "e-science" impacting the skills necessary for effective data management and curation, a curriculum designed to effectively prepare the next generation of scientists for the dynamic nature of research becomes necessary. This project, consisting of research teams from <a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>, the <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Minnesota</a>, the <a href="http://library.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon</a>, and <a href="https://www.library.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, aims to develop and implement a DIL curriculum in conjunction with university faculty to address these needs.</p>
  <p>This website will serve both as a source to obtain continued updates and information on the development of the DIL curriculum as well as a collaborative workspace within which researchers working on the project can meet to discuss their progress. Navigation of the website is available along the left-hand menu. The search box is also available via the menu at the top of the page if you are looking for something specific. Please continue to check back for updates on the site, where announcements and news will be posted as they become available.</p>
