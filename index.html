<p>Welcome to the working space for the <a href="http://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a> funded research project investigating data information literacy (DIL) needs of e-scientists. With the continued evolution of technology driven research or "e-science" impacting the skills necessary for effective data management and curation, a curriculum designed to effectively prepare the next generation of scientists for the dynamic nature of research becomes necessary. This project, consisting of research teams from <a href="https://www.lib.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>, the <a href="https://www.lib.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota</a>, the <a href="http://library.uoregon.edu/">University of Oregon</a>, and <a href="https://www.library.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>, aims to develop and implement a DIL curriculum in conjunction with university faculty to address these needs. </p>
<p>This website serves both as a source to obtain continued updates and information on the development of the DIL curriculum as well as a collaborative workspace within which researchers working on the project can meet to discuss their progress. Navigation of the website is available along the left-hand menu. Please continue to check back for <a href="/blog">updates</a> on the site, where announcements and news will be posted as they become available. </p>
