<h2>Interview Instruments</h2>
<!-- Content -->
<p>The documents offered below comprise the instruments that were used to interview the faculty and graduate students who agreed to participate in the Data Information Literacy (DIL) project.  The results of the interviews conducted by the librarians in this project will be used in conjunction with literature reviews and environmental scans to develop a DIL program that is based on disciplinary and local lab practices. </p>
<p>The interview instrument contains two parts: an Interview Worksheet and an Interviewerâ€™s Manual.  These parts are designed to be used in tandem with each other.  Though many of the questions contained in the faculty and student instruments are similar, the documents do differ slightly from one another.  The interview worksheet is given to the faculty or graduate student at the beginning of the interview.  He or she is then asked to complete the worksheet one module at a time.  As he or she completes a question, the interviewer asks the follow up questions that are contained in the Interviewer's Manual.</p>
<p>We are making this instrument publicly available with the hope that it will be useful for the broader community of information professionals.  Please note that this tool was designed to be generic in nature so that it can cover any discipline. As a result, users of these tools may wish to adjust some of the questions or content in these instruments in order to suit particular needs, interests, or contexts.</p>
<p>In addition, faculty and students interviewed may have varying degrees of understanding of the concepts and skills discussed in these documents.  Therefore, some of the terms and concepts may have to be explained in further detail by the interviewer during discussion.</p>
