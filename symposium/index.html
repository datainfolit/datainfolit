<h2>Program</h2>
<p>This symposium explored roles for practicing librarians in teaching competencies in data management and curation to graduate students.  With support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, librarians from Purdue University, Cornell University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oregon have investigated this topic through developing and implementing “data information literacy” (DIL) instruction programs for graduate students in a range of science and engineering disciplines.  </p>
<p>Members of the DIL project shared their experiences in working with faculty and graduate students, with a primary focus on the practical applications of their work.  Keynote speakers provided additional perspectives on teaching data literacy competencies.  A portion of the conference was devoted to further exploration of selected topics of interest as determined by attendees.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>Attendees acquired an understanding of current issues in teaching data management and curation competencies to students.   Through presentations, discussions and hands-on activities, attendees developed strategies for creating their own instructional programs suitable for the needs of their students and faculty.</p>
<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>Academic librarians and others who are providing research data management instruction for students, or librarians who are interested in doing so.</p>
