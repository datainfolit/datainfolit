<p>Program:  This symposium will explore roles for practicing librarians in teaching competencies in data management and curation to graduate students.  With support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, librarians from Purdue University, Cornell University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oregon have investigated this topic through developing and implementing “data information literacy” (DIL) instruction programs for graduate students in a range of science and engineering disciplines. </p>
<p>Members of the DIL project will share their experiences in working with faculty and graduate students, with a primary focus on the practical applications of their work.  Keynote speakers will provide additional perspectives on teaching data literacy competencies.  A portion of the conference will be devoted to further exploration of selected topics of interest as determined by attendees.</p>
<p>Outcomes: Attendees will acquire an understanding of current issues in teaching data management and curation competencies to students.   Through presentations, discussions and hands-on activities, attendees will develop strategies for creating their own instructional programs suitable for the needs of their students and faculty.</p>
<p>Intended audience: Academic librarians and others who are providing research data management instruction for students, or librarians who are interested in doing so. </p>
<p>Poster Session: Attendees who have developed educational initiatives, crafted resources, or conducted research in this area are invited to submit materials for a poster session, which will be held at the pre-symposium reception on Sunday, September 22nd. Attendees will be provided with information on how to submit a poster after they have registered for the symposium. </p>
<p>Schedule:  A reception will be held on Sunday Sept 22nd from 6-8pm at the South Ballroom in the Purdue Memorial Union. The symposium registration will begin at 8am on Monday Sept 23rd.  The symposium will conclude on Tuesday Sept 24th at 3pm. </p>
