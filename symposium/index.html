<h2>Program</h2>
<!-- Content -->
<p>This symposium explored roles for practicing librarians in teaching competencies in data management and curation to graduate students.  With support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, librarians from Purdue University, Cornell University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oregon have investigated this topic through developing and implementing “data information literacy” (DIL) instruction programs for graduate students in a range of science and engineering disciplines.  </p>
<p>Members of the DIL project shared their experiences in working with faculty and graduate students, with a primary focus on the practical applications of their work.  Keynote speakers provided additional perspectives on teaching data literacy competencies.  A portion of the conference was devoted to further exploration of selected topics of interest as determined by attendees.</p>
