<p>The <a href="http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/titles/format/9781612493527" target="blank">Data Information Literacy book</a> was published in January 2015 by the Purdue University Press and compiles the different strategies and approaches used for developing data information literacy programs at Purdue University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Oregon, and Cornell University. The book includes an introduction of the concepts and ideas behind data information literacy, descriptions of the five case studies conducted, and a “DIL Toolkit” or a handbook for librarians interested in developing DIL programs. For more information on the book and where to buy it, please visit the <a href="http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/titles/format/9781612493527" target="blank">Purdue University Press</a> website.</p>

Paper presented at the 8th International Digital Curation Conference, Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
<p>This presentation describes the early results from the Data Information Literacy (DIL) project designed to identify the educational needs of graduate students across a variety of science disciplines and respond with effective educational interventions to meet those needs. Interviews of the students and faculty members present a detailed snapshot of graduate student needs in data management education. Our findings from the project interviews are analyzed here, with a preview of the five proposed and ongoing training approaches as of January, 2013.</p>
