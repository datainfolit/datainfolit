Data Information Literacy project members Jake Carlson (Purdue University), Michael Fosmire (Purdue University), Marianne Stowell Bracke (Purdue University), Lisa Johnston (University of Minnesota), Brian Westra (University of Oregon), and Sarah Wright (Cornell University) will be presenting Friday, April 12th as part of the Association of College and Research Libraries annual conference in Indianapolis, IN.

The team will be leading a panel entitled "Growing E-Scientists: Developing Discipline-Specific Data Literacy Curricula," which will run from 1:30-2:30pm EST. A summary of the panel's focus is offered below.

"This panel presents the experiences of five teams from four different institutions working directly with faculty in science and engineering disciplines to determine what data skills graduate students need in order to be proficient ‘e-scientists.’ We will summarize the results of our interviews and needs assessments, provide a brief overview of the instructional interventions developed to meet those needs, and discuss the differences and similarities we found in data management / curation needs across disciplines."

Portions of ACRL 2013 will be broadcasted live over the Internet as part of the event's Virtual Conference program. Please click here for more details on the presentations to be made available online.
