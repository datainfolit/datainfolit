This fall, the Data Information Literacy team will be holding a symposium to cover major themes and approaches to data management and curation training. Details concerning the event, including dates and topics, are still being determined. Make sure to bookmark this page and follow us on Twitter for the latest updates.

As a reminder, our Publications page contains links to both articles and presentations pertaining to the DIL project.

The page has recently been updated to include links to our presentation at IDCC '13 as well as IMLS WebWise 2013.

Additional articles and presentations will be posted in the very near future.
