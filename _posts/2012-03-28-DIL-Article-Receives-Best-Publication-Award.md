"Determining Data Information Literacy Needs: A Study of Students and Research Faculty" has been selected as the winner of the [ASEE ELD](http://depts.washington.edu/englib/eld/) 2012 Best Publication Award.

The article, co-written by Jake Carlson, Michael Fosmire, Chris Miller, and Megan Sapp Nelson, was published in portal: Libraries and the Academy in 2011 and introduced the concept of data information literacy, providing some preliminary insight into how data information literacy might be defined.

Members of the review committee praised the article for providing "a very realistic overview of how data could be managed at many academic institutions." Committee members also stressed the success of the article in exploring the roles of all major players in the research process, including graduate students, faculty members, and librarians.
