The Data Information Literacy (DIL) Project's extended abstract submission to the 8th International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) in Amsterdam has been accepted.

The conference, which will take place from January 14-16 in the Netherlands, is organized by the Digital Curation Centre, a world-leading center of expertise in digital information curation based in the United Kingdom.

This year, IDCC's theme is "Infrastructure, Intelligence, Innovation: Driving the Data Science Agenda." The DIL project will be presenting a paper discussing the results of interviews conducted with faculty members and students performing research in a variety of disciplines across five different U.S. universities.

Additionally, the paper and presentation will include the educational interventions employed by project teams to address the needs identified during the interviews.
