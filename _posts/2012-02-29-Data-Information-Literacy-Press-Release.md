The Purdue News Service has issued a press release detailing the specifics of the Data Information Literacy project. A snippet of the release can be read below - for the full story, please follow the "Continue Reading..." link at the bottom of this post.
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. â€“ In partnership with librarians at the University of Minnesota, the University of Oregon and Cornell University, Purdue University Libraries received nearly $250,000 from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to develop training programs for the next generation of scientists to enable them to find, organize, use and share data efficiently and effectively.
The program is intended for graduate students in engineering and science disciplines who are working their way toward careers as research scientists, said Jake Carlson, a Purdue associate professor of library science who is leading the collaboration. 
"Technology has made it easier to share research data beyond the lab in which it was originally created," Carlson said. "The problem right now is that in many cases data are not being administered in ways that enable them to be easily discovered, understood or repurposed for use by other researchers."
Please check back for continued updates as the project progresses.
