On Monday, June 18 and Tuesday, June 19, members of the data information literacy project will converge at Purdue University to take part in a workshop designed to elicit discussion concerning the interviews and analysis performed by teams thus far.
During the course of the two-day workshop, team members from Cornell University, Purdue University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Oregon will look to identify common themes running across the work that has been completed at this point in the project. Additionally, the group will begin designing possible educational interventions and curricula to be implemented at each institution.
To follow updates from the workshop, make sure to follow @dataintolit on Twitter. The team will be utilizing the #datainfolit hash tag for news and updates from the event.
