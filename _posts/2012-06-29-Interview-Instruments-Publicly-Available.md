On Wednesday, several documents were posted to the wiki which comprise the interview instruments utilized by Data Information Literacy (DIL) researchers to conduct conversations with faculty members and graduate students at multiple universities regarding their data management practices and proficiencies. 

The instruments have been made publicly available in the hopes that librarians at other institutions will re-purpose them for their own usage. As explained on our Materials page - where you can download the documents - the instruments are generic in nature so that they can be applied to any research discipline.

We welcome any questions and feedback on the interview instruments and invite you to send them to us. For discussion concerning the interview instruments, please use the #datainfolit tag on Twitter.
